## How to run on Linux

> üí° File to use: `rock_paper_scissors_linux.asm`

1. Install NASM and GCC:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nasm gcc
```

2. Compile and run:

## How to run on Windows

> üí° File to use: `rock_paper_scissors_win.asm`

1. Download and install:
   - [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/)
   - [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) (provides GCC)

2. Open **Command Prompt**, go to your project folder:
```cmd
cd path\to\your\project
```

3. Compile and run:
```cmd
nasm -f win32 rock_paper_scissors_win.asm -o rps.obj
gcc rps.obj -o rps.exe -m32
rps.exe
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you install the **32-bit version of GCC** with MinGW.

```

2. Compile and link:
```bash
nasm -f macho64 rock_paper_scissors_macos.asm -o rps.o
ld -macosx_version_min 10.7.0 -lSystem -o rps rps.o
```

> ‚ùó If `ld` gives an error, try using `clang` instead.

3. Run the game:
